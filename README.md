# IchibanID: A Matching System for Those Who Don't Want to Be Scored

> You only have one self.  
> You only need one identity.  
> You deserve to be loved without being ranked.

---

## 🧠 What is this?

**IchibanID** is a prototype idea for a non-evaluative, trust-based matching system.

It’s based on three principles:
- You are only one person — no alternate accounts.
- Your personality matters — not your social rank.
- Real love happens when data steps back.

---

## 🔐 Concept

- 🌐 **1 person = 1 account**, enforced through biometric identity (like iris scan)
- 🧬 **Big Five personality traits** as the foundation (no scoring, only resonance)
- 🌈 **Matching results shown via poetry or color** — not numbers, not “likes”
- 🤖 **AI does not make choices for you** — only assists when invited

---

## 💡 Why?

Because we’re tired of being optimized.  
Because dating apps became marketplaces.  
Because love is not a KPI.  
Because some people deserve to be loved even if they’re not “recommended.”

## ✨ Tech stack (planned)

- OpenAI API (for dialogue and description)
- Big Five-based personality diagnostics
- n8n for automation
- Figma / Glide / Webflow for early UI and MVP prototyping

---

## 🧪 Prototype vision

1. Iris or unique-code login screen (only one account per person)
2. Big Five test interface (simple, friendly)
3. Output in poetic/visual form — e.g., "You feel like warm green. You may hurt each other beautifully."
4. No logs. No rankings. One chance per encounter.
